CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:34 (project):
  No CMAKE_ASM_COMPILER could be found.

  Tell CMake where to find the compiler by setting either the environment
  variable "ASM" or the CMake cache entry CMAKE_ASM_COMPILER to the full path
  to the compiler, or to the compiler name if it is in the PATH.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:34 (project):
  The CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:

    /home/ae/projects/forks/LensorOS/user/libc/cmake-build-minsizerel/g++

  is not a full path to an existing compiler tool.

  Tell CMake where to find the compiler by setting either the environment
  variable "CXX" or the CMake cache entry CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to the full path
  to the compiler, or to the compiler name if it is in the PATH.
