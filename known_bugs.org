* `bg servertest`, `clienttest` on startup triple faults
Posted [2024-06-24 Mon 16:22]

Running `bg servertest` and then `clienttest` as the first and second commands upon boot, respectively, triple faults after the client? exits.

Now, this wouldn't be so weird if all of the following didn't work just fine:
- Calling any other program(s) (like `ls`) as the first or several first command(s) and then calling `bg servertest` then `clienttest`.
- Calling `bg servertest` as the first command, then calling one or more other programs (like `ls`), then calling `clienttest`.
- The mixture of the above two cases, calling another program, then `bg servertest`, then another program, then `clienttest`.

Since all of those work, it's quite confusing as to what the nature of the bug actually is. I suspect that this will just magically go away one day as bugs get fixed, code gets rewritten, etc.

What's for certain is it's all an absolute mess right now, and I'm surprised it functions at all.
