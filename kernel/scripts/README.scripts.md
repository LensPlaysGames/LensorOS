### `mkimg.sh` <a name="mkimg-sh"></a>
Generate a UEFI-compatible bootable disk image file with everything necessary to boot LensorOS loaded onto it (namely the bootloader and kernel binaries, but also resources like the font).

The disk image generated may be formatted onto an actual USB drive using a tool like `dd`, or it may be used by a virtual machine that supports (U)EFI to boot from directly, like QEMU.

NOTE: The bootloader and kernel binaries **must** be built prior to running this script (see build instructions in the README within the source directory of the repository).

Invocation:
```bash
bash mkimg.sh
```

Dependencies:
- GNU MTools
  - For pre-built releases, see the [releases section of my fork of GNU MTools on GitHub](https://github.com/LensPlaysGames/mtools/releases)
  - On Debian distributions: `sudo apt install mtools`
  - [Source Code](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mtools/mtools-4.0.38.tar.gz)
    - There are great instructions and scripts included to help with generating executables for a variety of platforms. On Windows, you may need to utilize WSL to bootstrap the Windows executable counter-part of MTools.
- `dd`
  - Default with GNU/Linux
  - On Windows, **any *one* of the following**: 
    - [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)
	- [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)
	- [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)

### `mkiso.sh`  <a name="mkiso-sh"></a>
Generate a bootable ISO-9660 filesystem in the "El Torito" configuration. This image could be burned to an actual disk and booted from as a live CD, or attached to a virtual machine in VirtualBox as outlined in the README in the root directory of the repository.

NOTE: This script runs `mkimg.sh` to generate the FAT32 image, then generates the `.iso` file from that image.

Invocation:
```bash
bash mkiso.sh
```

Dependencies:
- [GNU xorriso](https://www.gnu.org/software/xorriso/)
  - On Debian distributions: `sudo apt install xorriso`
  - Pre-built Windows executables can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/PeyTy/xorriso-exe-for-windows)
  - [Source Code](https://www.gnu.org/software/xorriso/xorriso-1.5.4.pl02.tar.gz)

### `mkgpt.sh` <a name="mkgpt-sh"></a>
Generate a GPT formatted disk image file with an EFI System partition containing the image file generated by [mkimg.sh](#mkimg-sh).

The disk image generated may be formatted onto an actual drive, or it may be used by a virtual machine that supports (U)EFI to boot from, like VirtualBox (install as AHCI hard drive) or QEMU (see [runhda.sh](#runhda-sh) or [runhda.bat](#runhda-bat)).

NOTE: This script runs `mkimg.sh` to generate the FAT32 image, then generates the `.bin` file from that image.

Invocation:
```bash
bash mkgpt.sh
```

Dependencies:
- [mkgpt]()
  - [Source Code](https://github.com/jncronin/mkgpt)
  - [Helper Installation Script on Linux](#install-mkgpt-sh)

---

### `run.sh` <a name="run-sh"></a>
Launch QEMU, a virtual machine, with the proper command line flags and options to boot into LensorOS.

NOTE: This script assumes that a `LensorOS.img` has been built with the [mkimg.sh](#mkimg-sh) script.

Invocation:
```bash
bash run.sh
```

Dependencies:
- [QEMU x86_64](https://www.qemu.org/download/)

---

### `rundbg.sh` <a name="rundbg-sh"></a>
Do the same as the [run.sh](#run-sh) script, but instruct QEMU to halt CPU execution until the GNU DeBugger (GDB) has been attached.

Invocation:
```bash
bash rundbg.sh
```

Dependencies:
- [QEMU x86_64](https://www.qemu.org/download/)

---

### `runhda.sh` <a name="runhda-sh"></a>
Launch QEMU with the necessary flags to launch from `/kernel/bin/LensorOS.bin`, a GPT formatted disk image.

NOTE: This script assumes that a `LensorOS.bin` has been built with the [mkgpt.sh](#mkgpt-sh) script.

Invocation:
```bash
bash runhda.sh
```

Dependencies:
- [QEMU x86_64](https://www.qemu.org/download/)

---

### `run.bat` <a name="run-bat"></a>
Launch QEMU, a virtual machine, with the proper command line flags and options to boot into LensorOS.

Mainly included for users of the [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal), as it understands ANSI terminal color codes in PowerShell. By invoking this script from that terminal's PowerShell (seen below), the terminal output from LensorOS becomes legible, and colorful (as it looks on Linux by default).

If you are not interested in terminal debug output, you may simply double click this batch file to launch QEMU in `cmd.exe`, which does not understand ANSI terminal escape sequences, leaving the terminal output quite mangled (although everything will still work just fine).

NOTE: This script assumes that a `LensorOS.img` has been built with the [mkimg.sh](#mkimg-sh) script.

Invocation (PowerShell):
```powershell
.\run.bat
```

Dependencies:
- [QEMU x86_64](https://www.qemu.org/download/)

---

### `rundbg.bat` <a name="rundbg-bat"></a>
Do the same as the [run.bat](#run-bat) script, but instruct QEMU to halt CPU execution until the GNU DeBugger (GDB) has been attached.

Invocation (PowerShell):
```powershell
.\rundbg.bat
```

Dependencies:
- [QEMU x86_64](https://www.qemu.org/download/)

---

### `runhda.bat` <a name="runhda-bat"></a>
Launch QEMU with the necessary flags to launch from `/kernel/bin/LensorOS.bin`, a GPT formatted disk image.

NOTE: This script assumes that a `LensorOS.bin` has been built with the [mkgpt.sh](#mkgpt-sh) script.

Invocation (PowerShell):
```powershell
.\runhda.bat
```

Dependencies:
- [QEMU x86_64](https://www.qemu.org/download/)

---

### `install_mkgpt.sh` <a name="install-mkgpt-sh"></a>
Attempt to download and compile the `mkgpt` tool, which is only available as source code (no prebuilt binaries). `mkgpt` will be insatlled into a subdirectory of the same name within your terminal's current working directory.

If you are on Windows, I wouldn't expect this script to work, and a Linux-to-Windows cross compilation is in your near future. At some point, I may make a fork of the source and provide Linux and Windows executable binaries for x86_64.

Invocation:
```bash
bash install_mkgpt.sh
```

Dependencies:
- Apt Package Manager
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [GNU Autotools (automake and autoconf)](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/)
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

---

### `visualize_includes.sh` <a name="visualize-includes-sh"></a>
Generate visual representations (PNG images) of the include dependencies present within the LensorOS kernel. This script may take some time to complete (>1min). It works by downloading a Perl script `cinclude2dot.pl` if it hasn't already, and running that to generate the dependency data in a format Graphviz understands: `.dot`. 

With this `.dot` file, the script then generates PNG images using two different visual filters in Graphviz: one for a directed graph and one for an undirected graph. All of the downloaded and generated files may be found in the `/kernel/include_visualization` directory.

Invocation:
```bash
bash visualize_includes.sh [OPTIONS]
```
Square brackets denote a field is optional.

Options:
- `-i <paths>`
  - If headers are not being detected by the Perl script, add the path(s) to them with this option. For the LensorOS kernel, this mostly means a path to the compiler's library include directory. `paths` is a comma separated list of paths to directories.

Dependencies:
- [Curl](https://curl.se/)
  - Default on most systems (Windows, GNU/Linux)
- [Perl](https://www.perl.org/)
  - Default on most systems (Windows, GNU/Linux)
- [Dot/SFDP](https://www.graphviz.org/download/)

### `startup.nsh` <a name="startup-nsh"></a>
This is a file used by `mkimg.sh` to ensure the bootloader is ran when the computer boots from the generated image.

---

### `kernel.ld` <a name="kernel-ld"></a>
This linker script is used by the LensorOS toolchain when compiling the LensorOS kernel.
